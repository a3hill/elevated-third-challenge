# Elevated Third Frontend Challenge

This site was created using the base theme of Zurb Foundation for its simple grid structure.

## Comments and Questions

I used skewed pseudo elements to create the angeled images. I experimented with a cleaner solution by using `clip-path` to create the same effect, however IE11 and Edge do not currently support this property. 

None of Durpal's performance enhancing features have been utilized, I assume those would be leveraged on the production site.
